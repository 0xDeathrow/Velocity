In the velocity folder I have dropped in 5 screenshots for a project called TypeX

This is a crypto keyboard extension for iphone and android that allows users to trade directly within the keyboard itself.

the keyboard has a wallet and a trading terminal built in to allow fast paced trading without having to leave the application the user is in

I need to build a demo of this with some different scenarios so this can be shown to investors and potential users.

I want this to be an interactable web page emulating an android phone screen, with the keyboard being the main focus.

The first scenario should be the user sitting in a telegram chat, there is the ca "5UUH9RTDiSpq6HKS6bp4NdU9PNJpXRXuiw6ShBTBhgH2" sent by another user. In this demo the CA should be clickable, when the CA is clicked, the keyboard should open with a very similar UI to the file @Insta but this should be different enough that it does not look copied. This should also feature the logo in file @15, if the CA is double clicked this should open a different view showing the TROLL memecoin chart from pump fun with a buy and sell button either side of the chart. all still being within the keyboard space and showing the logo in @15
